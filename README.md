# AddressBookJava

This application simulates a simple address book that allows you to add a series of 'buddies' and takes down each buddy's name, address and phone number. 
The list of buddies and their info is displayed and the user has the option to save their book as an xml so they can come back to it later.

## Installation
1. Download source files and add them to a new java project
2. Include SampleAddress.xml in the same folder as the project
3. Run the program from the main method in the AddressBookFrame class

## Usage
- Add a new buddy using the `Add Buddy` button under the `Buddy Options` header. The buddy info will appear as a colon separated list
- Select a buddy and click `Remove Selected Buddy` to delete them from the list. An error message will pop up if a buddy is not selected
- Click `Create New Book` under the `Address Book Options` tab to clear the existing book.
- Save or import a book by clicking the appropriate menu buttons and entering the name of the XML file to save it to. SampleAddress.xml is given as an example of how the data will be saved
- `Create Sample Book` will provide an example of how a completed book should look
