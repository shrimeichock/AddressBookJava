# AddressBookJava

This application simulates a simple address book that allows you to add a series of 'buddies' and takes down each buddy's name, address and phone number. 
The list of buddies and their info is displayed and the user has the option to save their book as an xml so they can come back to it later.

##Installation
1. Download source files and add them to a new java project.
2. Include SampleAddress.xml in the same folder as the project.
3. Run the program from the main method in the AddressBookFrame class

##Usage
- Add a new buddy using the 'Add Buddy' button under the 'Buddy Options' header
